My role was listed as Backend Engineer, and eventually changed to Software Engineer.<br><br><h4>What did I go there to learn?</h4><br>As well as being a convenient job offer, having just graduated, I went to OXIL for a few reasons. I wanted to learn how a small company is run - what are the pitfalls, what works, what are the important activities and processes? Being at a small company also forces you to "wear many different hats", I had heard, which I expected to mean that I would do software engineering from many different angles.<br><br>#<h4>Small company pitfalls</h4>Customer leads are nothing if they don't actually want what you're selling, and it's much easier to convince someone that they want what you're selling in real life than 4 weeks after you've met them on an email.<br><br>Fear in your employees is so dangerous. If you've hired properly, your best employees have better opportunities a couple of door-knocks away, and if they are afraid there's stagnation of personal growth or of income, you can quickly fall into turmoil. I think the only way to abate this is to ask for feedback from them regularly (and act on it, of course) and survey the landscape (or prepare a good network) so you're ready to hire replacements.<br><br>New employees take a silly amount of time to train to proficiency. It's hard to tell if a good introductory training course would improve this.<br><br>Letting things get a bit bad (in the accounting side for example) can cost massive amounts to repair - it really is like a form of debt.<br><br>#<h4>What works in a small company?</h4>Being incredibly adaptable to a clients needs is something that I think it's hard for big companies to offer. Sometimes you have been doing something wrong for a long time and you just need to scrap it and try something else. You can do this, it's actually a good thing to do sometimes.<br><br>People who are multitalented are worth a crazy amount when specialisation is a farce - one of the team was Brazilian and very charismatic, and he worked wonders on some South American potential clients at a conference we went to... and he was the website designer and video guy!<br><br><h4>Many different hats</h4>One thing I didn't realise was that "many different hats" meant more than doing different types of software engineering. My time was spent as:<br><br>- a data analyst (30%)<br>- a software engineer (25%)<br>- a data engineer (25%)<br>- a database administrator (6%)<br>- a project manager (5%)<br>- a policy analyst (5%)<br>- a devops engineer (3%)<br>- a salesman (1%)<br><br>#<h4>Data Analyst</h4>It is vitally important to spot check data that comes in if you're going to draw confident conclusions from in - it's not that hard to do, read the first 100 rows, make a few bar charts, if there's something seriously awry, it will likely appear. For some types of data, it's also important to have a domain expert spot check it. For one of my projects, I found that many internet domains were being "Unregistered". It was only when a domain expert looked at the data and said that was very unlikely that I looked deeper and found that the results from the ICANN mandated WHOIS/RDAP services sometimes just 404 (Page not found) randomly, even if the domain is registered.<br><br>#<h4>Data engineer</h4>Data engineering is very hard, tedious, and painful and if I encounter data engineers I should take pity on them and be generous. Testing is still a useful practice for data engineering, but you must be creative and strategic in the types of tests that you write and you must accept that they will always be flaky. Often the parsing and normalisation of scraped data is the hardest part. A nice web API with good docs is at least 10x easier to get useful data out of than a strangely structured webpage that doesn't want to be scraped (if you're manually creating the parser, at least - I think LLMs could help here a lot).<br><br>#<h4>General insights</h4>If you are working on the wrong thing, you can easily waste multiple days, weeks, even years of your life. Example: In my free time I made some visualisations for sizing the Turkish solar panel market in Python with a Jupyter notebook - tooling and convenience matters so much. It was so comfortable - almost relaxing - and probably the same speed as using the tools at work, even though I had no experience in seaborn and very little experience using Jupyter notebooks.<br><br>Receiving feedback is so important for my stress levels. When I wasn't receiving any constructive criticism for multiple months, I had to constantly stare at my own work and pick holes in it to try and get better, and this was gruelling. Example: I felt one of the projects I was data analyst for wasn't making progress nearly as fast as it should've been, and I frustratedly spent my evening doing a write-up of the flaws in our process (which I never showed anyone) just to try and vent out some of the critical feeling.<br><br>Simple is so much better, so much of the time. I thought I was clever, but trying to implement even slightly complex things in a big system is just so much harder than implementing the simple solution, and the truth is that in practice no-one ever cared that it was slightly more flawed - if it's simple you can at least understand what those flaws are. Example: searching for brand infringement in domain names can be done really quite well with a regex.<br><br>Bash (and the command line) is sick, even though it's horribly weird.<br><br><h4>Conclusion</h4>I actually enjoyed a lot of the work I did at OXIL, and I think it will turn out to be quite useful for the world. The unrelenting pragmatism has rubbed off on me quite strongly I think, but I think the biggest impacts from it on my life are probably yet to be understood. I'm looking forward to my new role immensely - it's time to really sharpen myself technically.

<a name='2024-05-25-takeaways-from-100-games.md'></a><h3>Takeaways from 100 games</h3><br>Mark Brown from GMTK recently released a video called "The 100 Games That Taught Me Game Design". Here are some of my takeaways.<br><br><h4>Tetris and diagetic difficulty</h4>In Tetris, you place down blocks as well as you can to survive and to make your future easier. The amazing thing about Tetris, however, is that the difficulty is caused almost entirely by the player.<br><br>When you place down a block shoddily, that block remains on your screen for the whole game, until you finally manage to expensively repair the operation by entirely filling up the line which your mistake was on. If you make more mistakes, the old blunders can be forgotten temporarily, buried under the new shape of your board. But if you manage to reckon with your newer mistakes, you will finally be reunited with the older ones, after having had some time to think about them.<br><br>This process naturally creates a story where the player makes their own nemesis, deals with its minions, and then has to try and face it again, with their new ideas about how to defeat it. What a "foil" that is - your nemesis is literally your own past errors.<br><br><h4>Plants Vs Zombies</h4>"If you're ever unsure about how a genre works, find a game that boils it down to its absolute essentials, and start there"<br><br><h4>Civilisation 5</h4>"It's easier to grok a game about egyptians, bananas, and warplanes than it is to grok a game about Protoss, vespene gas, and photon cannons"

<a name='2024-04-26-log-fibonacci.md'></a><h3>A logarithmic algorithm for Fibonacci numbers</h3><br>I've been reading the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Abelson, Sussman), and within it, I found a beautiful algorithm for the Fibonacci numbers.<br><br>The intuitive relation for the Fibonacci numbers is:<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>-- Haskell code
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
</code></pre><br>While it is amazing that this code snippet runs correctly in Haskell, unfortunately, this way of doing recursion is in general slow. Let's expand a few terms for `n = 4`.<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>fib 4 = fib 3                 + fib 2
fib 4 = fib 2         + fib 1 + fib 1 + fib 0
fib 4 = fib 1 + fib 0 + 1     + 1     + 1
fib 4 = 1     + 1     + 1     + 1     + 1
</code></pre><br>The number of operations quickly grows with `n` - worse than `O(n)`. You may be thinking, "why can't we just reuse the result for `fib 2`? Why not memoise/cache the results?"<br>We can do better by caching in place. Consider the Fibonacci sequence as a child of a function like this:<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>fibNext a b = (a + b, a)
</code></pre><br>Try transforming this quickly into an algorithm yourself.<br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>Ok, here's mine:<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>fib n = fibIter 1 1 n

fibIter _ b 0 = b
fibIter a b n = fibIter (a + b) a (n - 1)
</code></pre><br>Now, we have `O(1)` memory usage and `O(n)` time complexity.<br>But... this isn't even close to the best algorithm. <br><br>Let's do some experiments.<br><code>
(a, b)
(a + b, a)
(2a + b, a + b)
(3a + 2b, 2a + b)
(5a + 3b, 3a + 2b)
(8a + 5b, 5a + 3b)
</code><br>At each successive fibNext, we seem to be producing the Fibonacci sequence within the coefficients. Notice how the middle 2 coefficients always match. Writing these transformations as matrices, we get:<br><code>
|1 1| * |a|
|1 0|   |b|
...
|8 5| * |a|
|5 3|   |b|
</code><br>Calling our first matrix `T`, we can hypothesise a form for any `T^n`. Try and guess the form, keeping in mind the original Fibonacci relation `fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)`.<br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>Ok, the form of `T^n` is:<br><code>
|(p + q) q|
|   q    p|
</code><br>You can prove by induction that any `T^n` will be of this form. Using this, we can get a formula for `(T^n)^2`. You may be starting to get an inkling of how to improve the algorithm now... think `2^8 = (2^4)^2 = ((2^2)^2)^2 = ...`.<br>So, if:<br><code>
T^n = |(p + q) q|
      |   q    p|
</code><br>Then:<br><code>
T^(2n) = |(p + q) q| |(p + q) q| 
         |   q    p| |   q    p|
       
       = |(p^2 + 2pq + 2q^2) (    2pq + q^2)|
         |(      2pq +  q^2) (p^2     + q^2)|
</code><br>Try and work from here to find the algorithm yourself!  <br><br>Hint: The time complexity is `O(log n)`. Try and write a logarithmic time exponentiation algorithm first using `(b^(n/2))^2 = b^n`!  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>Hint 2: Write a function `fibIterT` of so that:<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>fibIterT p q a b n =
  |(p + q) q| ^n |a|
  |   q    p|    |b|
</code></pre><br>Ok, here it is:<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>fibIterT _ _ a b 0 = b
fibIterT p q a b n
  | even n = fibIterT p' q' a b (n `div` 2)
  | otherwise = fibIterT p q a' b' (n - 1)
  where
    a' = (p+q)*a + q*b
    b' = q*a + p*b
    p' = p^2 + q^2
    q' = 2*p*q + q^2

fib n = fibIterT 0 1 1 1 n
</code></pre><br>Hopefully you can see where `p'` and `q'` come from. If you have an odd n, you can just multiply by your pq matrix once, and you'll be back to an even n. This is the origin of `a'` and `b'`, `pq_matrix (a, b) = (a', b')`.<br><br>SICP has been really interesting so far. I can finally see why people enjoy writing Lisp, even if it is horrendously ugly - it's very simple, and all the brackets make sure that you're never confused about operator precedence!

<a name='2024-03-29-social-media-and-lobbies.md'></a><h3>Social media</h3><br>I watched a video today about the power the Israel lobby has over American politicians, and how AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) has had people within the US Government in charge of Foreign Policy. Here is the video:<br><br><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdpIRMZoSw'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdpIRMZoSw</a><br><br>It really made me realise how privileged we are to be living in an age of social media, where the views of people are not shaped by centralised organisations who control media (e.g. traditional newspapers and TV channels), but by the decentralised diffusion of content made by individuals and teams all around the world which is then doled out by "the algorithm" according to how well the content will capture attention.<br><br>The beauty of "the algorithm" is that it continually must experiment - it is adaptive, not frozen in time, or held down by a higher authority (*worth exploring how it may be held down by a higher authority later). This means that individuals sometimes see random videos which are not similar to the others which they usually watch (e.g. today I also watched a video of an Eastern-European design professor making a lamp out of thin plywood using a laser cutter like we used at school).<br><br>This prevents any one ideology from completely taking hold without criticism - as long as there is at least one individual willing to put in the work to publish a critical piece, there will be an opportunity for that piece to propagate. Controversy attracts attention [1], so there is a living chance that the critique will be caught by those with an open mind, who will then have the opportunity of a balanced opinion where both sides may be empathised with.<br><br>I hope that we can build a model of social media where this strength is preserved yet the dulling and polarising effects of attention-as-a-score oriented algorithms on people's minds are reduced.<br><br>[1] This is actually more controversial than I thought writing this the first time. Here is what the marketers think:<br><a href='https://core.ac.uk/reader/214210540'>https://core.ac.uk/reader/214210540</a><br><a href='https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1528077'>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1528077</a><br>Both papers show an "inverted U" relation between controversy/anger and engagement. In other words, controversial articles do better until they get too controversial.

<a name='2024-03-13-blockchain-basics.md'></a><h3>Blockchains and Merkel trees</h3><br>Prereqs:<br>- Hashing<br>- Linked List<br><br>You need a blockchain for success. It's a simple fact of life. This article will tell you what one is, and how to make one.<br><br>A linked list is a value, and a pointer to the next list (or some "end of list", which is often written as None, Nil, or []).<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>-- Linked list with values of type "a" in Haskell
data LinkedList a = Node {val :: a, next :: LinkedList a}
                  | EndOfList

-- The same thing written more concisely
data List a = Cons a (List a)
            | Nil
</code></pre><br><br>A blockchain is very similar, but as well as storing the value of a node and the pointer to the next list, we store a the *hash* of the value of the previous node. <br><br>Say you wanted to have a blockchain with a list of names of people who you have high fived, whilst ensuring that no one could falsely claim that you'd high fived them by modifying the earlier elements of the list. You could store the names as a blockchain.<br><br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>hash :: String -> Int
hash = (`mod` 128) . sum . map fromEnum

data Blockchain = Node String Int Blockchain
                | EndNode Int
                deriving Show -- To be able print the data in Haskell
</code></pre><br><br>Looks pretty similar to the linked list from earlier... We will store the hash of each string value as an Int for ease of use. So can we create a blockchain from a list of strings?<br><br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>fromList :: [String] -> Blockchain
fromList xs = fromListAux xs 0
    where
        fromListAux [] prevHash = EndNode prevHash
        fromListAux (h:t) prevHash = Node h prevHash (fromListAux t (hash h))
</code></pre><br><br>In Haskell <code>(h:t)</code> is a pattern matching on the first element of the list (the "head") and the rest (the "tail"). So what would an example blockchain look like?<br><br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>exampleBlockchain = fromList ["Sam", "Rich"]
-- Node "Sam" 0 (Node "Rich" 33 (EndNode 6))
</code></pre><br>Note that <code>hash "Sam" == 33</code> and <code>hash "Rich" == 6</code>. If anyone tries to mess with the names in the list, say by inserting a new one, then the chance that the EndNode will be valid is very unlikely.<br><br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>validate :: Blockchain -> Bool
validate (EndNode 0) = True
validate (EndNode _) = False
validate chain = go chain 0 -- Valid chains start with 0
    where
        go (Node val expectedHash rest) prevHash = (expectedHash == prevHash) && go rest (hash val)
        go (EndNode lastHash) expectedHash = lastHash == expectedHash
</code></pre><br>This validate function lets us check whether the hashes of each node line up.<br><pre><code class='language-haskell'>validate (Node "Sam" 0 (Node "Rich" 33 (EndNode 6)))
-- True

validate (Node "Sam" 0 (Node "Ron" 33 (EndNode 6)))
-- False, hash "Ron" is 47, not 6
</code></pre><br>This means that if we know the hash in the EndNode, we can be confident in validating the whole chain. You'll notice that validating a blockchain requires looking at every node (if the validation doesn't exit on a failure early). To prevent this, in real usecases, people use alternative data structures, like Merkel trees, which can be validated by only looking at <code>log n</code> nodes.
